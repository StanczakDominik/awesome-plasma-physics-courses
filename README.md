## Plasma Physics

- [22611, Introduction to Plasma Physics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-611j-introduction-to-plasma-physics-i-fall-2003/index.htm) - MIT (2003).
	- The course introduces plasma phenomena relevant to energy generation by controlled thermonuclear fusion and to astrophysics, coulomb collisions and transport processes, motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, plasma confinement schemes, MHD models, simple equilibrium and stability analysis. It also covers two-fluid hydrodynamic plasma models, wave propagation in a magnetic field, kinetic theory, Vlasov plasma model, electron plasma waves and Landau damping, ion-acoustic waves, and streaming instabilities.
- [761, Plasma Physics I](http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~drake/classes/physics761/) - UMD (2017).
	- An introduction to the basic concepts and phenomena of plasma physics. Topics include: Ionization and collisional processes, kinetic and fluid treatments, wave-particle interactions and quasilinear theory, MHD theory, plasma waves, particle orbits and plasma stability. These topics will be discussed as they apply to laboratory and space plasmas.
- [762, Plasma Physics II](http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~drake/classes/physics762/) - UMD (2017).
	- The dynamics of plasmas are often controlled by nonlinear behavior. This course will introduce some of the basic techniques which have been developed  to understand and describe these dynamics with applications in space and laboratory plasmas. Topics include nonlinear waves and shocks, wave-particle interactions, quasilinear theory and maps, wave-wave interactions, parametric instabilities, drift-waves and transport, Navier Stokes and MHD turbulence, cascade processes and internittancy, magnetic reconnection and the dynamo.
- [Plasmaphysik I](https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_19_20/A_Plasmaphysik/vorlesung/index.html) - LMU (2012).
	- An introduction to the basic concepts and phenomena of plasma physics.
- [Plasmaphysik II - Kernfusionsforschung](https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/sose_20/A_PlasmaphysikII/vorlesung/index.html) - LMU (2010).
	- Topics include: introduction to nuclear fusion, magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, transport in magnetized plasmas, plamsa diagnostics.

## MHD

- [22.615, MHD Theory of Fusion Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-615-mhd-theory-of-fusion-systems-spring-2007/) - MIT (2007).
	- This course discusses MHD equilibria in cylindrical, toroidal, and noncircular tokamaks. It covers derivation of the basic MHD model from the Boltzmann equation, use of MHD equilibrium theory in poloidal field design, MHD stability theory including the Energy Principle, interchange instability, ballooning modes, second region of stability, and external kink modes. Emphasis is on discovering configurations capable of achieving good confinement at high beta.
- [MA5902, A mathematical introduction to Magnetohydrodynamics](https://www-m16.ma.tum.de/Allgemeines/MHD19) - TUM (2019).
	- The course provides a basic introduction to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), with emphasis on its mathematical aspects (as opposite to physical phenomena). Essentially, MHD is the theory of electrically conducting fluids in presence of a magnetic field. Since MHD is one of the two building blocks (together with kinetic theory) of theoretical plasma physics, its understanding is of paramount importance for applied mathematicians who deal with plasma physics and nuclear fusion applications.
- [Advanced Fluid Dynamics](http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/AdvFD/) - Oxford (2020).
	- Part I: MHD equations: conservation laws in a conducting fluid; Maxwell stress/magnetic forces; induction equation; Lundquist theorem, flux freezing, amplification of magnetic field. MHD in a strong guide field: MHD waves; high-beta and anisotropic limits and orderings; incompressible MHD, Elsasser MHD, Reduced MHD. Static MHD equilibria, force-free solutions, helicity, Taylor relaxation. Energy principle. Instabilities: interchange, Z-pinch.
	- Part II: Fluid mechanics with general extra stress. Dilute suspension of spheres: Einstein viscosity. Dilute suspension of beads on springs: Oldroyd-B model for polymeric liquids, elastic waves, anisotropic pressure. Dilute suspension of orientable particles (ellipsoids): road map to liquid crystals, swimmers and active matter.

## Transport

- [22.616, Plasma Transport Theory](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-616-plasma-transport-theory-fall-2003/) - MIT (2003).
	- This course describes the processes by which mass, momentum, and energy are transported in plasmas, with special reference to magnetic confinement fusion applications. The Fokker-Planck collision operator and its limiting forms, as well as collisional relaxation and equilibrium, are considered in detail. Special applications include a Lorentz gas, Brownian motion, alpha particles, and runaway electrons. The Braginskii formulation of classical collisional transport in general geometry based on the Fokker-Planck equation is presented. Neoclassical transport in tokamaks, which is sensitive to the details of the magnetic geometry, is considered in the high (Pfirsch-Schluter), low (banana) and intermediate (plateau) regimes of collisionality.

## Waves

- [553 Plasma Waves and Instabilities](http://www.princeton.edu/~idodin/ast.htm) - Princeton (2017).
	- Hydrodynamic and kinetic models of nonmagnetized and magnetized plasma dispersion; basic plasma waves and their applications; basic instabilities; mechanisms of collisionless dissipation; geometrics-optics approximation, including ray tracing, field-theoretical description of continuous waves, and ponderomotive effects; conservation laws and transport equations for the wave action, energy, and momentum; mode conversion; quasilinear theory.

## Fusion
- [Fusion Research Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9F2aQG5CnOdw9MXqS309tojBUvChQ9jm).
	- Goes through applications of plasma physics to magnetic confinement fusion in tokamaks and stellarators. To quote: "This lecture is usually given as a classical blackboard lecture at the University of Stuttgart. Due to the current situation (Corona-virus), the lecture has to be given completely online. The videos shown here are small modifications of the videos actually used in the lecture (mostly copyright issues).". By Alf KÃ¶hn-Seemann.
